# Adblock Rules

Useful rules for
[AdBlock](https://getadblock.com)/[Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/)-compatible
ad blockers, mostly for (German) news sites.

I recommend using [µBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).

## No Comment ([link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cwickert/adblock-rules/master/no-comment.txt))

Removes forums and user comments from popular news sites

Allowing morons to share their 'thoughts' does not make the web more social,
quite the contrary: [Many comments are racist, xenophobic, misogynic](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/12/the-dark-side-of-guardian-comments),
or just plain stupid. Even on	well-respected sites like [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com)
or [Die Zeit](http://www.zeit.de), trolls dominate the discussion. There is no
use arguing with these [loosers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/07/20/men-who-harass-women-online-are-quite-literally-losers-new-study-finds),
just use this filter and ignore all the negative energy.


## Anti-social (TBD)

Removes more 'social' features such as trending articles and sharing.


## Out of service ([link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cwickert/adblock-rules/master/out-of-service.txt))

Removes 3rd party 'services' such as job, real estate, or product search etc.


## Push requests welcome!
For instructions on writing filters, refer to the Adblock Plus
[how-to](https://adblockplus.org/en/filters) and
[cheat sheet](https://adblockplus.org/en/filter-cheatsheet). Unfortunately
[µBlock does not support some filters](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax),
but supports advanced dynamic filtering, so please only use the common subset
for maximum compatibility.
