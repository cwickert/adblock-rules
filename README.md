# Adblock Rules

Useful rules for
[AdBlock](https://getadblock.com)/[Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/)-compatible
ad blockers, mostly for (German) news sites.

I recommend using [ÂµBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).

## No Comment ([link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cwickert/adblock-rules/master/no-comment.txt))

Removes forums and user comments from popular news sites

Allowing morons to share their 'thoughts' does not make the web more social,
quite the contrary: [Many comments are racist, xenophobic, misogynic](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/12/the-dark-side-of-guardian-comments),
or just plain stupid. Even on	well-respected sites like [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com)
or [Die Zeit](http://www.zeit.de), trolls dominate the discussion. There is no
use arguing with these [loosers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/07/20/men-who-harass-women-online-are-quite-literally-losers-new-study-finds),
just use this filter and ignore all the negative energy.
