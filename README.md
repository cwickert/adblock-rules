# Adblock Rules

Useful rules for
[AdBlock](https://getadblock.com)/[Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/)-compatible
ad blockers, mostly for (German) news sites.

I recommend using [ÂµBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).

## No Comment

Removes forums and user comments from popular news sites

Allowing morons to share their 'thoughts' does not make does not the web more
social, quite the contrary: [Many comments are racist, xenophobic, and
misogynic](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/12/the-dark-side-of-guardian-comments).
Even on	well-respected sites like [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com)
or [Die Zeit](http://www.zeit.de), trolls dominate the discussion. With this
filter, you can simply ignore all this negative energy.
